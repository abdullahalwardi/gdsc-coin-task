# gdsc-coin-task
Task no.2 for our flutter team in GDSC-Aliraqia

Task: Create a Coin Toss App

In this task, our team will build an app that simulates flipping a coin. The app should display an image of a coin and a button. When the user taps the button, the app should randomly select either "heads" or "tails" and display the result on the screen.

Here are the steps to follow:

1- Create a new Flutter project.
2- Replace the default app icon with an image of a coin.
3- Create a stateful widget for the coin.
4- Add a button widget to the stateful widget.
5- Write a function that generates a random result of either "heads" or "tails".
6- Add a click listener to the button that calls the function and updates the state of the coin widget to display the selected result.
7- Style the coin widget to make it look like a real coin (e.g., circular shape, heads and tails images, etc.).
8- Test the app on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it works correctly.
